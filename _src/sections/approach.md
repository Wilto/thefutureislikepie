Working with information on the web—displaying it, labeling it, connecting it, designing it—means changing that information. Every decision alters how information can be found, understood, and used, for better or for worse.

That's a tremendous amount of power to wield, and I'm vigilant about how that power impacts users. I make decisions that consider that impact first and foremost, prioritizing stress cases, information literacy, accessibility, clarity, and inclusion.

My goal is to build digital experiences that empower users to make informed decisions, advocate for themselves and their communities, and change the world.
