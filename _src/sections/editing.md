I’m the managing editor for [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com), a publisher of brief books for web designers, developers, and other UX professionals. In addition to setting and overseeing editorial standards, I work closely with authors to guide concept development, narrative flow, and chapter organization for all of our books. Recent titles I’ve worked on include [Writing for Designers](https://abookapart.com/products/writing-for-designers) by Scott Kubie, [Image Performance](https://abookapart.com/products/image-performance) by Mat Marquis, [Conversational Design](https://abookapart.com/products/conversational-design) by Erika Hall, and [Going Offline](https://abookapart.com/products/going-offline) by Jeremy Keith.
