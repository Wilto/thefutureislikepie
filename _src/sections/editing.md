I’m the managing editor for [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com), a publisher of brief books for web designers, developers, and other UX professionals. In addition to setting and overseeing editorial standards, I work closely with every author in the developmental editing stage to guide the conceptual flow and narrative structure of their books.

Recent titles I’ve worked on include:
* [Responsible JavaScript](https://abookapart.com/products/responsible-javascript) by Jeremy Wagner
* [SEO for Everyone](https://abookapart.com/products/seo-for-everyone) by Rebekah Baggs and Chris Corak
* [Design for Safety](https://abookapart.com/products/design-for-safety) by Eva PenzeyMoog
