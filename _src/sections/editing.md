I am an energizing and approachable speaker (perfect for those first-thing-in-the-morning or [right-after-lunchtime](#) slots). I consistently receive high satisfaction scores on audience surveys, and enjoy the opportunity to teach (and learn from!) new crowds. You can see some of my slide decks on Slideshare.

My current talk, “Structuring Content to Empower Users,” can be given as a 45-minute talk or a three-hour workshop, and is available for conferences and corporate engagements in 2019.
