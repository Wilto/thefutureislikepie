I’m the managing editor for [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com), a publisher of brief books for web designers, developers, and other UX professionals. In addition to setting and overseeing editorial standards, I work closely with every author in the developmental editing stage to guide conceptual flow and narrative structure.

Recent titles I’ve worked on include:
*  [Expressive Design Systems](https://abookapart.com/products/expressive-design-systems) by Yesenia Perez-Cruz
* [Resilient Management](https://abookapart.com/products/resilient-management) by Lara Hogan
* [Conversational Design](https://abookapart.com/products/conversational-design) by Erika Hall 
* [Progressive Web Apps](https://abookapart.com/products/progressive-web-apps)  by Jason Grigsby
