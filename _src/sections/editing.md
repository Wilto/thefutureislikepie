I’m the managing editor for [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com), a publisher of professional books for designers, developers, content creators, and UX professionals. In addition to setting and overseeing editorial standards, I work closely with every author in the developmental editing stage to guide conceptual flow and narrative structure.

Recent titles I’ve worked on include:

* *[Voice Content and Usability](https://abookapart.com/products/voice-content-and-usability)* by Preston So
* *[Design for Cognitive Bias](https://abookapart.com/products/design-for-cognitive-bias)* by David Dylan Thomas
* [](https://abookapart.com/products/expressive-design-systems)*[Cross-Cultural Design](https://abookapart.com/products/cross-cultural-design)* by Senongo Akpem
