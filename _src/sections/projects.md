My projects focus on the strategic and structural portions of website design. I facilitate workshops with client teams to set strategic direction, and create artifacts (recommendations, analyses, sitemaps, etc.) in support of that direction. 

Engagements may be one-off (such as a workshop) or part of a larger initiative. I often collaborate with design teams and agencies, including [Brain Traffic](https://www.braintraffic.com/), [Happy Cog](https://www.happycog.com/), [Seven Heads Design](http://www.sevenheadsdesign.com/), and [National Design Service](https://nationaldesignservice.com/). 

Recent clients include Vectorworks, Carnegie Mellon University, the Posse Foundation, Gettysburg College, The Associated Press, Seton Hill University, University of California, and Autodesk.
