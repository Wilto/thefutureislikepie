My projects focus on the strategic and structural portions of website design. I facilitate collaborative workshops with client teams to set strategic direction, and create artifacts (recommendations, analyses, sitemaps, etc.) to support that direction. 

I often partner with design teams and agencies, including [Brain Traffic](https://www.braintraffic.com/) and [Happy Cog](https://www.happycog.com/). Recent clients include Adobe, MassMutual, Vectorworks, egghead.io, Carnegie Mellon University, the Posse Foundation, Gettysburg College, and the Associated Press.
