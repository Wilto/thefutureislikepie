My projects focus on the strategic and structural portions of website design. I facilitate collaborative workshops with client teams to set strategic direction, and create artifacts (recommendations, analyses, sitemaps, etc.) to support that direction. 

I often partner with design teams and agencies, including [Brain Traffic](https://www.braintraffic.com/), [Happy Cog](https://www.happycog.com/), [Seven Heads Design](http://www.sevenheadsdesign.com/), and [National Design Service](https://nationaldesignservice.com/). 

Recent clients include MassMutual, Vectorworks, egghead.io, Carnegie Mellon University, the Posse Foundation, Gettysburg College, The Associated Press, University of California, and Autodesk.
