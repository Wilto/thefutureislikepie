My projects focus on the structure of digital systems, particularly for enterprise content. I specialize in helping clients understand the current strengths and opportunities in their digital properties, and providing strategic recommendations to address challenges in their content and site structure.

Recent clients include Indiana University, Included Health, Adobe, HealthPartners, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, MassMutual, Vectorworks, and Carnegie Mellon University. I frequently partner with agencies such as [Brain Traffic](https://www.braintraffic.com/).
