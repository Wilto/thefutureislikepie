I love delivering talks to a crowd. In addition to local meetups and corporate events, I have spoken at conferences such as:

* Confab Central
* Design & Content Conference
* World IA Day
* Confab Higher Ed
* Content Strategy Summit
* Web Design Day
* BlendConf
* MIMA Summit

I am an energizing and approachable speaker (perfect for those first-thing-in-the-morning or right-after-lunchtime slots). I consistently receive high satisfaction scores on audience surveys, and enjoy the opportunity to teach (and learn from!) new crowds.
