My current talk, “[Structuring Information to Empower Users](https://www.confabevents.com/2019-sessions/structuring-content-to-empower-users),” can be given as a 45-minute talk or a three-hour workshop, and is available for conferences and corporate engagements in 2019.

I am an energizing and approachable speaker (perfect for those first-thing-in-the-morning or right-after-lunchtime slots). I consistently receive high satisfaction scores on audience surveys, and enjoy the opportunity to teach (and learn from!) new crowds. You can see some of my slide decks on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/redsesame).
