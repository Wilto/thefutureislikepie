Working on the web means organizing informationâ€”structuring it, displaying it, labeling it, connecting it. Every design decision alters how information can be found, understood, and used.

That's a tremendous amount of power to wield, and I'm vigilant about how that power impacts users. I make decisions that consider that impact first and foremost, and work to build experiences that are clear, usable, and inclusive. In my work, I prioritize stress cases, information literacy, accessibility, and inclusion.

I often partner with design teams and agencies, including [Brain Traffic](https://www.braintraffic.com/), [Happy Cog](https://www.happycog.com/), [Seven Heads Design](http://www.sevenheadsdesign.com/), and [National Design Service](https://nationaldesignservice.com/). 

Recent clients include Vectorworks, Carnegie Mellon University, the Posse Foundation, Gettysburg College, The Associated Press, Seton Hill University, University of California, and Autodesk.
