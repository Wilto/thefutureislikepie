I believe firmly in Richard Saul Wurman's axiom, “The creative organization of information creates new information." Working on the web means organizing information—structuring it, displaying it, labeling it, connecting it. Every decision alters how information can be found, understood, and used.

As a designer and strategist, I'm vigilant about that power—and its impact on people. I make decisions that consider that impact first and foremost, and work to build experiences that are clear, usable, and inclusive. In my work, I prioritize stress cases, information literacy, ethics, accessibility, and diversity.

I often partner with design teams and agencies, including [Brain Traffic](https://www.braintraffic.com/), [Happy Cog](https://www.happycog.com/), [Seven Heads Design](http://www.sevenheadsdesign.com/), and [National Design Service](https://nationaldesignservice.com/). 

Recent clients include Vectorworks, Carnegie Mellon University, the Posse Foundation, Gettysburg College, The Associated Press, Seton Hill University, University of California, and Autodesk.
