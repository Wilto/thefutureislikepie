[_Everyday Information Architecture_](https://abookapart.com/products/everyday-information-architecture) is out on **April 16, 2019**, from A Book Apart. It's a practical guide for designers, developers, and other web workers who want to make better, more intentional, more inclusive sitemaps and taxonomies.

I write [articles about IA, UX, and content strategy on my blog and elsewhere](thefutureislikepie.com/blog). I also write a [tinyletter](https://tinyletter.com/thefutureislikepie) with brief observations about my professional (and sometimes personal) life, links to compelling cultural criticism, and worthwhile causes for giving. 

Additionally, I write and publish poetry. My poems have appeared in _Indiana Review_, _Pleiades_, _American Journal of Poetry_, _Crab Orchard Review_, _Puerto del Sol_, and others.
