I am the author of [_Everyday Information Architecture_](https://abookapart.com/products/everyday-information-architecture), a practical guide to IA for designers, developers, and other web workers who want to make more intentional sitemaps and information structures.

I am the coauthor of [_You Should Write a Book_](https://abookapart.com/products/you-should-write-a-book), a demystifying look at the process of pitching, drafting, editing, and marketing booksâ€”a must-read for anyone who's ever wanted to write a book. 

I write a [monthly newsletter](https://thefutureislikepie.beehiiv.com/subscribe) about design, technology, writing, and culture.
