[_Everyday Information Architecture_](https://abookapart.com/products/everyday-information-architecture) is out on **April 16, 2019**, from A Book Apart. It's a practical guide for designers, developers, and other web workers who want to make better, more intentional, more inclusive sitemaps and taxonomies.

I write occasional articles about UX topics in various corners of the web:

* [_Collaborative Content Design and Content Audits_](https://www.contentstrategy.com/podcast/ep-11-collaborative-content-design-and-content-audits-with-lisa-maria-martin) on The Content Strategy Podcast (interview by Kristina Halvorson)
* [_The System, the Search, and the Food Bank_](https://24ways.org/2018/the-system-the-search-and-the-food-bank/) (on 24Ways)
* [_Information Literacy is a Design Problem_](https://24ways.org/2016/information-literacy-is-a-design-problem/) (on 24Ways)

I also write a [tinyletter](https://tinyletter.com/thefutureislikepie) with brief observations about my professional (and sometimes personal) life, links to compelling cultural criticism, and worthwhile causes for giving. 

Additionally, I write and publish poetry. My poems have appeared in _Indiana Review_, _Pleiades_, _American Journal of Poetry_, _Crab Orchard Review_, _Puerto del Sol_, and others.
