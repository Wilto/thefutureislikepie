Aimed at web designers and developers, it makes the principles of information architecture more accessible and practical to teams without working content or IA professionals.

I write a monthly newsletter that features brief observations about my professional (and sometimes personal) life, along with commentary on current articles. You can sign up for it (and read previous issues) at tinyletter.

I write occasional articles about content strategy, IA, and UX in various corners of the web, including this site. Recent articles include:

* [_Collaborative Content Design and Content Audits_](https://www.contentstrategy.com/podcast/ep-11-collaborative-content-design-and-content-audits-with-lisa-maria-martin) on The Content Strategy Podcast (interview by Kristina Halvorson)
* [_Information Literacy is a Design Problem_](https://24ways.org/2016/information-literacy-is-a-design-problem/) (on 24Ways)

Additionally, I write and publish poetry. My poems have appeared in Indiana Review, Pleiades, American Journal of Poetry, Crab Orchard Review, Puerto del Sol, and others. You can support my writing via Patreon, where I share a weekly newsletter of poems curated from around the web.
