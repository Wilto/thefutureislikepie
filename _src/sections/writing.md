I am the author of [_Everyday Information Architecture_](https://abookapart.com/products/everyday-information-architecture), a practical guide to IA for designers, developers, and other web workers who want to make more intentional sitemaps and information structures.

I am the coauthor, along with Katel LeDû, of [_You Should Write a Book_](https://abookapart.com/products/you-should-write-a-book), a demystifying look at the process of pitching, drafting, editing, and marketing books—a must-read for anyone who's ever wanted to write a book. (You should!)

I write a [tinyletter](https://tinyletter.com/thefutureislikepie) with brief observations about my professional (and sometimes personal) life, links to compelling journalism and media, and worthwhile causes for giving. I occasionally write articles about IA, UX, and content strategy [on my blog and elsewhere](/blog). 

Additionally, I write and publish poetry. My poems have appeared in _Indiana Review_, _Pleiades_, _American Journal of Poetry_, _Crab Orchard Review_, _Puerto del Sol_, and others. My poem "Situation Normal" won the 2019 Prism Review Contest ([Issue 21](https://artsci.laverne.edu/prism/issues-samples/)).
